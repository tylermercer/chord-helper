# Chord Helper

This is a small open-source Android application designed to help with practicing guitar chord changes. It uses BPM data from [GetSongBPM](getsongbpm.com). 

The GetSongBPM API key is not stored in this repo. If you want to fork this project and run it on your own device, you must put your own key in `lib/API_KEY.dart`.
