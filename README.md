# Chord Helper

This is a small open-source Android application designed to help with practicing guitar chord changes. It uses BPM data from [GetSongBPM][getsongbpm.com]. The API key is not stored in this repo. If you want to fork this project, you must create your own `API_KEY.dart` file in the `lib/` directory with your own key, e.g.

```
var API_KEY = "put-your-api-key-here";
```
