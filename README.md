# Chord Helper

This is a small open-source Android application designed to help with practicing guitar chord changes. It uses BPM data from Spotify's public API. To acquire a temporary token for this API, it makes a request to https://spotify-web-api-token.herokuapp.com/token.

TO-DO: Add buttons for selecting keys to practice, rather than shuffling the entire list of chords.
