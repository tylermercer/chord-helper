# Chord Helper

This is a small open-source Android application designed to help with practicing guitar chord changes. It uses BPM data from Spotify's public API. To acquire a temporary token for this API, it makes a request to https://spotify-web-api-token.herokuapp.com/token, which was [built by José M. Pérez](https://github.com/JMPerez/spotify-web-api-token).

TO-DO: 
* Add buttons for selecting keys to practice, rather than shuffling the entire list of chords.
* Spin up my own instance of [the Spotify Web API Token Generator](https://github.com/JMPerez/spotify-web-api-token).
